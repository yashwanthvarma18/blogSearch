This is a simple blog search application that allows users to search for blogs by title, tags, and clubs. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Running the Application



### Code Explanation

The code for the blog search application is divided into three files:

* `index.html`: This file contains the HTML code for the application.
* `script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code for the application.
* `styles.css`: This file contains the CSS code for the application.

The `index.html` file contains the basic HTML structure of the application. It includes the HTML code for the header, navigation bar, and main content area. The `script.js` file contains the JavaScript code for the application. It includes the code for filtering and displaying the blogs. The `styles.css` file contains the CSS code for the application. It includes the styles for the header, navigation bar, and main content area.
